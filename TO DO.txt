Change game sprites (School theme)


~~implement enemy to randomly teleport~~ 
      Already given to vampire ability
~~implement invincibility~~ 
      Perhaps as a pickup item or cooldown on spell.
~~implement enemy to move and bounce around (of walls)~~
    Eyeball object already has this effect.

~~implement melee~~ 90%
      Melee hitbox appears.
      Hitbox origin inflicts damage on enemies.
      Still need to imply the hitbox indicators to collide with enemies.
      
~~implement corner shots (NE, NW, SE, SW)~~ Complete
      Weapon Upgrades that increases spread/amount of bolts
            bugs out the corner shots.
